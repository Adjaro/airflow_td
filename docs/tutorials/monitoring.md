# Monitoring the Airflow Pipeline

Monitoring your Airflow pipeline is crucial to ensure that your data workflows are running smoothly and efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to monitor your Airflow tasks and evaluate their performance.

## Setting Up Monitoring
 
1. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure that you have the necessary packages installed for monitoring. You can use the following command to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow[monitoring]
   ```

2. **Configure Airflow**: Update your `airflow.cfg` file to enable monitoring features. Look for the `[monitoring]` section and adjust the settings as needed.

3. **Use the Monitoring Script**: The `monitor.py` script included in this project can be used to monitor the performance of your data pipeline. You can run it using:

   ```bash
   python scripts/monitor.py
   ```

## Evaluating Performance

To evaluate the performance of your tasks, you can use the built-in metrics provided by Airflow. Here are some key metrics to monitor:

- **Task Duration**: Keep an eye on how long each task takes to complete. This can help identify bottlenecks in your pipeline.
- **Success Rate**: Monitor the success rate of your tasks to ensure that they are completing as expected.
- **Resource Usage**: Check the resource usage (CPU, memory) of your Airflow workers to ensure they are not overloaded.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor your Airflow pipeline and ensure that your data workflows are running efficiently. For more detailed information, refer to the [Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).
