# Data Pipeline Tutorial

This tutorial describes the data pipeline process, including data extraction, transformation, and prediction using Airflow with Docker.

## Overview

The data pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from various sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Prediction**: Use a machine learning model to make predictions based on the processed data.

## Steps

### 1. Data Extraction

In this stage, we will use the `extract.py` script to pull data from the specified sources. This can include CSV files, databases, or APIs.

### 2. Data Transformation

Once the data is extracted, we will use the `transform.py` script to clean and preprocess the data. This step is crucial for ensuring the quality of the data before it is fed into the prediction model.

### 3. Prediction

After transforming the data, we will utilize the `predict.py` script to make predictions. This script will leverage a pre-trained machine learning model to generate insights based on the input data.

## Conclusion

This data pipeline tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and executing a data pipeline using Airflow and Docker. Follow the steps outlined above to successfully implement your own data pipeline.
